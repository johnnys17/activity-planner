# Daily Activity Planner

## Overview
The Daily Activity Planner is a beginner-friendly JavaScript program that organizes a daily activity by storing its name and duration, categorizing its intensity, and displaying a plan. Created as part of my Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course, it showcases fundamental JavaScript skills in variables and conditionals for my journey to become a full-stack developer.

## Features
- Stores activity details (name, duration) using variables.
- Categorizes activity intensity (Light, Moderate) using conditionals and a ternary operator.
- Validates duration with `typeof` and logical operators.
- Performs calculations (e.g., total minutes, hours) using mathematical assignment operators.
- Displays results with template literals, string concatenation, and string methods like `toUpperCase()`.
- Handles `undefined` data for missing activities.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core language for logic and output.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment to run the program.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd activity-planner
